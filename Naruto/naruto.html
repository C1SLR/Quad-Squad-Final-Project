    <h2>Story Line</h2>
    <h5>Prologue:The Sealed Demon</h5>
    <p>
      In the bustling Hidden Leaf Village, a young boy named Naruto Uzumaki was
      born under extraordinary circumstances. Sealed within him at birth was the
      Nine-Tailed Fox, a powerful demon that had once wreaked havoc upon the
      village. Fearful of the demon's potential to cause further destruction,
      the village elders decided to seal it within Naruto, making him a pariah
      from the moment of his birth.
    </p>
    <h5>A Lonely Childhood</h5>
    <p>
      Naruto grew up alone and ostracized by his peers. His classmates avoided
      him, fearing the demon within him. The only person who showed him kindness
      was his teacher, Iruka Umino. Iruka saw the loneliness and determination
      in Naruto's eyes and became a surrogate father figure to the young ninja
    </p>
    <h5>The Academy Years</h5>
    <p>
      As Naruto grew older, he entered the Ninja Academy, where he trained
      alongside his classmates, including his rivals Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura
      Haruno. Naruto struggled to control the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, but with
      Iruka's guidance and his own determination, he eventually learned to
      harness its power.
    </p>
    <h5>The Chunin Exams</h5>
    <p>
      Naruto and his team were selected to participate in the Chunin Exams, a
      prestigious tournament that determined the next generation of elite ninja.
      During the exams, Naruto faced a series of grueling challenges, including
      a survival exercise in the Forest of Death and a battle against his rival,
      Neji Hyuga.
    </p>
    <h5>The Invasion of the Hidden Leaf Village</h5>
    <p>
      The Chunin Exams were interrupted by a devastating attack on the Hidden
      Leaf Village by Orochimaru, a powerful rogue ninja. Naruto and his team
      played a crucial role in defending the village, showcasing their growing
      skills and courage.
    </p>
    <h5>The Search for Sasuke</h5>
    <p>
      After the attack, Sasuke Uchiha betrayed his friends and left the village
      to seek revenge against his brother, Itachi. Naruto, determined to bring
      his friend back, embarked on a journey to find Sasuke.
    </p>
    <h5>Meeting Jiraiya</h5>
    <p>
      Along the way, Naruto met Jiraiya, a legendary ninja and former teammate
      of his father, the Fourth Hokage. Jiraiya recognized Naruto's potential
      and became his mentor, teaching him powerful techniques like the Rasengan
      and the Shadow Clone Technique.
    </p>
    <h5>The Akatsuki Threat</h5>
    <p>
      Naruto's journey took him across the world, where he encountered a variety
      of threats, including the Akatsuki, a powerful criminal organization
      seeking to capture the tailed beasts. Naruto formed alliances with other
      villages and discovered the true nature of his parents.
    </p>
    <h5>
        The Fourth Great Ninja War
    </h5>
    <p>
        Years later, the world was plunged into a devastating war as the Akatsuki unleashed their plan to resurrect the Ten-Tails, a powerful creature capable of destroying the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Naruto, now a seasoned ninja, joined the Allied Shinobi Forces in their fight against the Akatsuki. He faced countless challenges, including battles against powerful enemies like Madara Uchiha and Kaguya Otsutsuki.
    </p>
    <h5>
        The Finale Battle
    </h5>
    <p>
        With the help of his friends and allies, Naruto was able to defeat the Akatsuki and save the world from destruction. In the final battle, he unlocked the full potential of the Nine-Tailed Fox and gained the power of the Sage of Six Paths.
    </p>
    <p>
        Naruto's journey culminated in his victory over Kaguya Otsutsuki and the restoration of peace to the ninja world. He was hailed as a hero and was eventually appointed the Seventh Hokage, fulfilling his lifelong dream.
