    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      <b> Attack On Titan </b> (Shingeki no Kyojin) is a groundbreaking manga
      series created by Hajime Isayama, first serialized in 2009. The series
      gained immense popularity and was adapted into a highly acclaimed anime.
      Set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is on the brink of
      extinction due to giant humanoid creatures known as Titans, the narrative
      delves deep into themes of survival, freedom, identity, and the moral
      complexities of war.
    </p>
    <h4>Story Line</h4>
    <p>
      The story takes place in a world where humanity is confined within massive
      walled cities to protect themselves from Titans—gigantic beings that
      devour humans seemingly without reason. The three concentric walls—Wall
      Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sina—serve as humanity’s last bastions against
      extinction. Within these walls, society has developed a feudal system,
      with a distinct hierarchy that creates class divisions and social unrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storyline begins with the sudden appearance of the Colossal Titan,
      which breaches Wall Maria, allowing smaller Titans to invade. This event
      leads to the destruction of Eren's hometown and the death of his mother,
      igniting a fierce desire for vengeance against the Titans. Eren, Mikasa,
      and Armin enlist in the military, joining the Survey Corps to fight
      against the Titans and uncover the truth behind their existence.
    </p>
    <h4>Main Characters</h4>
    <p>
      <b> Eren Yeager </b>
      The protagonist, who dreams of freedom beyond the walls. His intense
      desire to eradicate Titans drives much of the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Mikasa Ackerman </b>
      Eren's adoptive sister and a prodigy in combat. She is fiercely protective
      of Eren and deeply loyal to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Armin Arlert </b>
      Eren’s childhood friend, known for his strategic mind. His intelligence
      often complements Eren’s impulsive nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Levi Ackerman </b>
      A captain in the Survey Corps, known as humanity’s strongest soldier. Levi
      is cold and pragmatic but deeply respects his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Historia Reiss </b>
      The true heir to the throne, she struggles with her identity and the
      expectations placed upon her.
    </p>
    <h4>Key Arcs and Themes</h4>
    <p>
      <b> The Fall Of Wall Maria </b>
      The initial arc sets the tone for the series, introducing the brutal
      reality of living under constant threat. The Colossal Titan’s attack leads
      to the introduction of key characters and establishes the urgency of
      humanity’s plight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Training And The Battle Of Trost</b>
      As Eren and his friends undergo rigorous training, they learn about the
      Titans and develop their combat skills. During the Battle of Trost, Eren
      discovers his ability to transform into a Titan, revealing a pivotal plot
      point that alters the dynamics of the conflict. This transformation raises
      questions about the nature of Titans and Eren's identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Female Titan Arc</b>
      This arc introduces a new antagonist, the Female Titan, who is revealed to
      be Annie Leonhart, a fellow soldier. This storyline explores themes of
      betrayal and the complexity of human emotions, as Eren grapples with the
      implications of having a friend who is also a Titan shifter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> The Clash of Titans </b>
      As the series progresses, more Titan shifters emerge, including Reiner
      Braun (the Armored Titan) and Bertolt Hoover (the Colossal Titan). This
      arc focuses on the conflict between the Survey Corps and these shifters,
      deepening the narrative’s exploration of loyalty, identity, and the cycle
      of hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Struggle for The Truth</b>
      Eren and his friends uncover secrets about the Titans, their origins, and
      the history of the world outside the walls. They learn about Marley, a
      nation that oppresses the Eldians (the descendants of those who can become
      Titans). This revelation shifts the focus from mere survival to a broader
      struggle for freedom and justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Marley Arc</b>
      The story shifts to Marley, where the political landscape and the dynamics
      between Eldians and Marleyans are explored. Eren’s transformation from a
      determined young man seeking freedom to a more complex character willing
      to embrace violence raises questions about morality and the cost of
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>War for Paradise</b>
      As the war between Marley and the Eldians on Paradis escalates, the
      characters must confront their beliefs and the consequences of their
      actions. Eren’s increasingly radical approach and the resulting conflict
      within the group challenge their bonds and force them to reevaluate their
      values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Finale chapters</b>
      The climax involves Eren initiating the "Rumbling," a catastrophic event
      that unleashes countless Colossal Titans contained within the walls to
      march across the world, aiming to eliminate all humanity outside Paradis.
      This drastic measure leads to internal conflict among the main characters,
      particularly between Eren and his friends, culminating in a tragic and
      complex resolution that examines the costs of freedom and the cycle of
      vengeance.
    </p>
