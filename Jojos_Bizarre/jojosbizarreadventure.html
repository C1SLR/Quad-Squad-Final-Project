    <p>
      The overarching narrative of "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure" is divided into
      multiple distinct parts, each with its own setting, characters, and
      thematic focus. Each part explores a different era and cultural backdrop,
      reflecting Araki's artistic evolution and response to contemporary trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Phantom Blood: </b>
      Set in the late 19th century, this arc introduces Jonathan Joestar, a
      nobleman whose life is turned upside down by the arrival of Dio Brando, an
      adopted member of the Joestar family who seeks to gain power through the
      use of an ancient stone mask. This part establishes the foundational
      themes of good versus evil, family honor, and the concept of "bizarre"
      supernatural elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Battle Tendency </b>
      Following Jonathan’s grandson, Joseph Joestar, this arc takes place in the
      1930s and focuses on ancient beings known as the Pillar Men, who threaten
      humanity. Joseph’s cleverness and tactical approach to battles highlight a
      shift in character development, emphasizing wit and strategy over sheer
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Stardust Crusaders </b>
      This part introduces the concept of "Stands," a pivotal element in the
      series. Jotaro Kujo, the grandson of Joseph, embarks on a journey to
      defeat Dio, who has returned as a powerful Stand user. The story spans
      various locations and features a diverse cast of allies and enemies, each
      with unique Stands, leading to iconic battles that have become hallmarks
      of the series.

      confront Stand users with dark intentions. This part introduces a more
      slice-of-life approach while maintaining the series’ trademark bizarre
      elements.

      Taking place in Italy, this arc follows Giorno Giovanna, the son of Dio,
      who aims to rise within the ranks of a mafia organization. The exploration
      of ambition, power, and morality culminates in intense confrontations and
      character development, further expanding the moral complexities of the
      Joestar legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Stone Ocean </b>

      JoJo protagonist. Jolyne must navigate a treacherous environment filled
      with Stand users while confronting her own family's legacy. The narrative
      explores themes of fate and free will, culminating in a profound and
      ambitious conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Steel Ball Run </b>
      This part represents a soft reboot of the series, taking place in the
      United States during the late 19th century. It follows Johnny Joestar, a
      paraplegic jockey, and Gyro Zeppeli, who participates in a cross-country
      race with supernatural elements. The narrative examines redemption, the
      nature of heroism, and personal growth through its intricate plot and
      character dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Jojolion </b>
      Set in the same universe as "Steel Ball Run," this arc follows Josuke
      Higashikata (a different character than Part 4's Josuke) in a
      post-disaster version of Morioh. The story intertwines themes of identity,
      memory, and the repercussions of past actions, creating a complex and
      layered narrative that challenges conventions of the series.

            journeys are reflective of broader human experiences, making the
